To align expectations: I’ll first confirm the core functional requirements. Once validated, I’ll move on to identifying core entities and responsibilities, ensuring each follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

Where variation is expected — such as payment methods or dispensing logic — I’ll abstract those using interfaces. I anticipate using patterns like Strategy and Factory to support future extensibility.

Let me know if that sounds like a good plan, or if you’d like to add anything upfront.

Questions :-
1. Should we just add payment support for currency for now and leave credit/debit upi as future extensions?
1. For change, should we assume that the machine has a infinite inventory of coins available?
1. Do we assume that each item has a fixed price at design time or do we want to support a dynamic pricing model?
1. What are the different types of item we want to support for the vending machine inventory?


Based on the problem statement and clarifications provided, here are the core functional capabilities I've derived for the system. Let me know if I've missed something or if you'd like to adjust the scope.

Core functionalities
1. User should be able to view and select an item from the vending machine
1. User should be able to insert money to purchase an item
1. The system should be able to validate the amount and dispense the item if payment is sufficient.
1. The user should be able to return appropriate in case of overpayment
1. The system should be able to support multiple items in the inventory
1. The system should be extensible to support multiple payment methods with minimal changes in the core logic


Great! Now that we have an agreement on the core functional capabilities, here're a list of core entities and their responsibilities that align with the single responsibility principle.

Core entities
2. Item : This entity represents an inventory item in the vending machine. Each item will have a name & price associated with itself. for now, we'll go with a pre-defined price for every item.
1. Inventory : This entity represents the vending machine inventory and is a collection of items.
1. PaymentStrategy : This entity represents the payment strategy used by the user to make a purchase. We'll use strategy pattern to design this entity. We'll have an IPaymentStrategy interface and for the core functionality, the CurrencyPayment will be extending it.
1. VendingMachineState : This entity represents the state of the vending machine depending on the transaction. I'll be modelling the transaction deterministically. I'll be using State design pattern for the same. For now I'll be considering 4 permissible states, which are IdleState, HasMoneyState, DispenseItemState, ReturnChangeState. All of these States will implement the IVendingMachineState interface - this way we are ensuring OCP. Each state will have a failure count threshold. If this is reached, the vending machine will fallback to its idle state.
1. VendingMachine : This is the vending machine entity. We'll be using Singleton creational pattern to design the vending machine. The initial state of the vending machine will be 'IdleState".

Let me know if the core entities align with your expectations or if you'd like me to make any adjustments.
